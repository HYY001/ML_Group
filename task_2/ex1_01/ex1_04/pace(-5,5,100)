'mvnpdf' is a function from the file C:\Octave\Octave-4.0.1\share\octave\packages\statistics-1.2.4\mvnpdf.m

 -- Function File: Y = mvnpdf (X)
 -- Function File: Y = mvnpdf (X, MU)
 -- Function File: Y = mvnpdf (X, MU, SIGMA)
     Compute multivariate normal pdf for X given mean MU and covariance
     matrix SIGMA.  The dimension of X is D x P, MU is 1 x P and SIGMA
     is P x P. The normal pdf is defined as

          1/Y^2 = (2 pi)^P |SIGMA| exp { (X-MU)' inv(SIGMA) (X-MU) }

     *Algorithm*

     Using Cholesky factorization on the positive definite covariance
     matrix:

          R = chol (SIGMA);

     where R'*R = SIGMA. Being upper triangular, the determinant of R
     is  trivially the product of the diagonal, and the determinant of
     SIGMA is the square of this:

          DET = prod (diag (R))^2;

     The formula asks for the square root of the determinant, so no
     need to square it.

     The exponential argument A = X' * inv (SIGMA) * X

          A = X' * inv (SIGMA) * X
            = X' * inv (R' * R) * X
            = X' * inv (R) * inv(R') * X

     Given that inv (R') == inv(R)', at least in theory if not
     numerically,

          A  = (X' / R) * (X'/R)' = sumsq (X'/R)

     The interface takes the parameters to the multivariate normal in
     columns rather than rows, so we are actually dealing with the
     transpose:

          A = sumsq (X/r)

     and the final result is:

          R = chol (SIGMA)
          Y = (2*pi)^(-P/2) * exp (-sumsq ((X-MU)/R, 2)/2) / prod (diag (R))
